    - text: "<b>Casual Photography: </b>I am not a professional photographer and do not own fancy equipment - that being said - I do really enjoy taking many bad photos with my phone. Very very <i>occasionally</i>, a few turn out okay - or at least I think so."
    - text: "<b>Economics: </b> Ever since high school economics has been one of my favourite subjects to learn about. I had the amazing opportunity to study it along with Computer Science during my time at university."
    - text: "<b>Transit Networks/Maps: </b>I am <em>very</em> into maps. In particular, my favourite is transit maps. I like everything that has to do with the transportation and movement of people and in particular their networks. If you would like to send me any cool maps please do!"
    - text: "<b>Photo Colourization: </b>A few years ago I started using Photoshop to colour old black and white photos by request. I cannot however post them here as they are still technically other peoples private photographs. If you're interested in getting a photo colourized you can ask me about it."
