  - text: Hello! My name is Jonathan Lucki and I am currently in my 3B term majoring Computer Science and minoring in Economics at the University of Waterloo.
  - text: I originally came to Waterloo with the most amazing dream - to become an <em>Accountant</em>. I was accepted into a specialized Mathematics and Accounting program and accepted without hesitation. However, after getting here I discovered however that accounting and business courses are horrendously boring... I enjoyed my CS courses much more, and were doing very well in them. As a result - I ended up switching majors and now I am a computer science student!

    - text: "<b>Transit Networks/Maps: </b>I am <em>very</em> into maps. In particular, my favourite is transit maps. I like everything that has to do with the transportation and movement of people and in particular their networks. If you would like to send me any cool maps please do!"
    - text: "<b>Photo Colourization: </b>A few years ago I started using my Photoshop skills to colour old black and white photos by request. I cannot however post them here as they are still technically other peoples private photographs. If you're interested in getting a photo colourized you can ask me about it."
