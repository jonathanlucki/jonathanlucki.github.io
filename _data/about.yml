  - text: Hello! My name is Jonathan Lucki and I am currently in my 3B term majoring Computer Science and minoring in Economics at the University of Waterloo.
  - text: I originally came to Waterloo with the most amazing dream - to become an <em>Accountant</em>. I was accepted into a specialized Mathematics and Accounting program and accepted without hesitation. However, after getting here I discovered that to me personally, I found my accounting and business courses are horrendously boring, especially compared to my math and computer science courses, of which I also was doing quite well in. As a result - I ended up switching majors and now I am a computer science student!
